# Analyzing the Stroop Effect 
In this small project a dataset about the Stroop effects will be statiscally analysed. No cleaning or assessing of the date is necessary. Only a statiscal analysis and the results gathered are presented. The test conditions can be found here. Also one can read more about this special phenomenon in the Wikipedia page.

## Background Information
In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

# Installation, Utilization and Scalability.
Just download Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) and run it on your own notebook. You can use a different dataset to analyse, the tools will be scalable and will adapt to new data. Wording and conlusions will have to be altered accodingly to the dataset.
